# Porltand Demolition Map 2000 - 2017

Map practice from Web Cartogrpahy workshop

Maps residential demolition permits by neighborhoods in Porltland using [Portland Maps Open Data](http://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/residential-demolition-permits?orderBy=YEAR&orderByAsc=false&where=UPPER(YEAR)%20like%20%27%25%25%27) and open source QGIS software.
